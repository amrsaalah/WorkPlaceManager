# WorkPlaceManager

WorkplaceManager is an android app where it is designed to help managers to manage employees and communicate with them in an easy and effective way.

This is the first android app that I have ever built. I worked on this project back in 2017 when I first started learning android development.

The app is written in Java with MVP architecture pattern.
